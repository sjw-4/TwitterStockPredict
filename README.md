# TwitterStockPredict
Using Twitter data and machine learning to predict stock prices... More for fun than anything serious

Using a Twitter handle and Stock ticker as input, the program will use stock history around the time of the tweets to try and predict how each tweet affects stock prices.
It uses nearest centroid to classify each previous tweet as successful or not in terms of the stock prices response.
It then uses Naive Bayes to classify the tweets.
After all is done, the user can enter a tweet (in theory, it could grab new tweets in real time) and the algorithm would recommend the user buy stock, sell stock, or hold.

It kind of works with Elon Musk's Twitter and Tesla stock, but in reality this was more of a fun project than anything serious.
